# Predicting Breast Cancer

The dataset was collected from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Coimbra). Studies have been [published](https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-017-3877-1) with this dataset to explore potential ways of predicting instances of breast cancer based on common blood tests, age and BMI. If highly accurate, breast cancer can be cheaply predicted using these common blood tests. The authors in the paper used logistic regression, random forests and support vector machine, and SVM was the most accurate model in predicting breast cancer. Let's see if we can replicate the results!
